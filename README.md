Abstract
========

On of the Internet’s recurring memes is a world where families have
children until they have a son, then stop. There seems to be a fairly
common misapprehension that this will lead to some asymmetry of sexes
in the next generation.

This short note explores this question: we quickly see that symmetry
is preserved, but then spend time exploring what’s going on in more
detail.Finally we introduce a new element to the model which, on its
own, favours neither boys nor girls, but allows social engineering to
skew the sex distribution.
